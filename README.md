Coffee App
===========

#####Assumptions:
- I assume that the order of the coffee list does not matter, because the design storyboard coffee list order is different then that given by the coffee API.

- In the design storyboard coffee list view the coffee image sizes seem to be arbitrary. For example, the affogato and the cappuccino images are of the same width and height, but the design storyboard displayed them as different sizes, so I assume that it is up to the developer to make the best judgement on how to properly size them.
